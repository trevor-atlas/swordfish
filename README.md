## Contribution guide

The Rules
1. Be patient. No matter what.
2. Donâ€™t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame.
3. Never assume the motives of others are, to them, any less noble than yours are to you.
4. Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself.
5. Laugh at yourself frequently.
6. Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.
7. Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.
8. Praise at least as often as you disparage.
9. Admit your errors freely and soon.
